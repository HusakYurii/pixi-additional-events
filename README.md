### pixi-dbclick-event
A feature for a PIXI.js to enable window double click event. The great thing is that it has the same behaviour and payload (event) as the other events have.

Since PIXI 5 has been split into components, I added a feature which uses the same flow that interaction manager has. Import the file in your index.js (at the top) and it should work fine.
